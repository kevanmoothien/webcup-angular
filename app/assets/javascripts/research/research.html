              <p class="card-text">Our team of researchers led by Dr Jon Snow are collaborating with the World Health Organisation in order to develop a vaccine for the alien virus. having joined the collective worldwide force against the alien invasion, we are on the forefront in the battle against the alien virus pandemic</p>
              <p class="card-text">Having an extensive experience in pathogenic medecine. Dr Snow is one of the pioneers of the alien counter measure task force. His expertise consists of one of our greatest weapons in the war against invasion and complete and utter annihilation</p>

              <p class="card-text">The majority of our funds are utilised to fund the research and developent of an antidote against the virus. A major part of this consists of providing our experts with latest technologies such as microparticle blasters, interelectron containers; which are high radioactive materials and the cause of our decline. However, they are also the key to our success against the extraterrestial threat.</p>

                <p class="card-text">A major risk involved when handling material coming fron deep space is that they are highly radioactive. The elements have enough radiation level that they can power Mega cities like New York for centuries!</p>
                <p class="card-text">Individuals and populations exposed to high doses of radiation display various types of detrimental effects. In some cases, the severity of these effects in an individual is proportional to the dose delivered – the higher the dose the greater the severity. Examples of such proportional effects are erythema (reddening of the skin), epilation (loss of hair), cataracts and “acute radiation syndrome.” These are known as deterministic effects and they all display a threshold: below a certain dose, no effects are observed.</p>
